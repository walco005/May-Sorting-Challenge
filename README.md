# May Sorting Challenge

This is a challenge I'm setting up for myself where I made up a way to sort integers and I will implement different sorting algorithms and analyze the results.

This is done in the same vein as the Sorting Competition held at the University of Minnesota, Morris in the Algorithms & Computability course.

This is the three ways the data will be sorted (in this order):

1 - How varied the digits are (using a 'variance index')

2 - The sum of the digits

3 - The actual numeric value (this will only be implemented if it really changes the data, it may or may not)
