# May Sorting Challenge

This is a challenge I'm setting up for myself where each week I will make up a different type of data/ways of sorting it and I'll implement different sorting techniques to find the most efficient way to sort it

This is done in the same vein as the Sorting Competition held at the University of Minnesota, Morris in the Algorithms & Computability course.

Week 1: Random integers that shall be sorted in two or three different ways, in the shown order:

1 - How varied the digits are (using a 'variance index')

2 - The sum of the digits

3 - The actual numeric value (this will only be implemented if it really changes the data, it may or may not)
